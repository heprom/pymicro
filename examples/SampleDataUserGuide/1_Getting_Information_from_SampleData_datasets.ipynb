    "SampleData datasets are composed of a set of organized data items. When handling datasets, you will need to specify which item you want to interact with or create. The `SampleData` class provides 4 different ways to refer to datasets. The first type of data item identificator is :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the **Path** of the data item in the HDF5 file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like a file within a filesystem has a path, HDF5 data items have a Path within the dataset. Each data item is the children of a HDF5 Group (analogous to a file contained in a directory), and each Group  may also be children of a Group (analogous to a directory contained in a directory). The origin directory is called the *root* group, and has the path `'/'`. The Path offers a completely non-ambiguous way to designate a data item within the dataset, as it is unique. A typical path of a dataitem will look like that : `/Parent_Group1/Parent_Group2/ItemName`. However, pathes can become very long strings, and are usually not a convenient way to name data items. For that reason, you also can refer to them in `SampleData` methods using:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the **Name** of the data item.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the last element of its **Path**, that comes after the last `/` character. For a dataset that has the path `/Parent_Group1/Parent_Group2/ItemName`, the dataset Name is `ItemName`. It allows to refer quickly to the data item without writing its whole Path.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that two different datasets may have the same Name (but different pathes), and thus it may be necessary to use additional names to refer to them with no ambiguity without having to write their full path. In addition, it may be convenient to be able to use, in addition to its storage name, one or more additional and meaningfull names to designate a data item. For these reasons, two additional identificators can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the **Indexname** of the data item\n",
    "4. the **Alias** or aliases of the data item\n",
    "\n",
    "Those two types of indentificators are strings that can be used as additional data item **Names**. They play completely similar roles. The **Indexname** is also used in the dataset Index (see below), that gather the data item indexnames together with their pathes within the dataset. **All data items must have an Indexname**, that can be identical to their Name. If additionnal names are given to a dataset, they are stored as an **Alias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many `SampleData` methods have a `nodename` or `name` argument. Everytime you will encounter it, you may use one of the 4 identificators presented in this section, to provide the name of the dataset you want to create or interact with. Many examples will follow in the rest of this Notebook, and of this User Guide.\n",
