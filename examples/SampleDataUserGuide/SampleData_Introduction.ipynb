    "## I - The SampleData platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pymicro* package is used on a daily basis by material scientists teams involved in the development of the data paradigm presented in section I. Its original design, that relied on classical Python and Numpy data objects to handle material data, dit not allow to efficiently handle the multi-modal 4D material science data challenges. Therefore, an new  subpackage has been introduced within *pymicro*, the `pymicro.core` subpackage, to serve as *pymicro*'s data platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "This `pymicro.core` package has been designed to be independent of the rest of the *pymicro* code. Its aim is to serve as a prototype implementation of what could constitute a large-scale data platform the material microstructure science community. In the future, it is likely that it will become a fully independent package, and hence an external *pymicro* dependency. In that case, it will most likely be name *SampleData*, as its main class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SampleData` is a Python class designed to implement two essential functions for the management of multimodal material data sets within the Pymicro code:\n",
    "1. A unified file format and data model able to handle all data modalities presented below, within the same dataset.\n",
    "2. A high-level interface allowing interactions with datasets for user and external numerical tools while hiding all the data management technical complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, it is designed to associate a dataset file for each material sample, whose data must be collected, stored and/or processed. The class then behave as a high-level interface allowing to interact with the data. Its main functionalities are:\n",
    "* Add, remove, and organize easily data of various types, formats, shapes into the same dataset\n",
    "* Add, remove and organize easily light metadata for all elements of a dataset\n",
    "* get simple or detailed information on the dataset content\n",
    "* allow easy visualization of spatially organized data (images, maps, measured or simulated fields)\n",
    "* allow a flexible and efficient compression of each element of a dataset\n",
    "* a framework to automate interface between the datasets and data processing or numerical simulation tools\n",
    "* a framework to derive classes from SampleData that are specialized to a specific type of material samples, such as the `Microstructure` class of the `pymicro.crystal.microstructure` module, dedicated to polycrystalline samples\n",
    "* ensure convergence of spatially organized data \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding this last point, the \"*convergence*\" of data refers to the conversion into a unified data model of all data representing microstructure geometries, of mechanical fields (measured or simulated), of different origins. This allows to directly visualize and process them together with the same tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SampleData` class is thus the interface that the data platform user has to manipulate in order to access those functionalities, and interact with the dataset. Its detailed presentation is the subject of the series of notebooks of which this document is only the first. The rest of the section is dedicated to the presentation of the file format and data model that is implement by the `SampleData` class."

    "###  The SampleData file format\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if its implementation does not require it, the `SampleData` class has been designed to be used with the following convention:  **1 dataset per material sample**. Each dataset is associated with a pair of files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a HDF5 file \n",
    "2. a XDMF file\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 is a library and file format that supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data.  It is a hierarchical file format in the sense that it allows to gather multiple data within a file and create links to organize them in relation to each other, creating an\n",
    "internal file hierarchy, replicating a file system with directories and files within one file. HDF5 stores data with a binary encoding, and is compatible with many of the most powerfull compression algorithms available. It also allows to add text metadata to all data elements in the file, called *HDF5 attributes*. **The HDF5 file, within the SampleData file pair, is the actual data set: it contains all data and metadata related to the material sample.**\n",
    "\n",
    "XMDF is an extensible Data Model to exchange scientific data between High Performance Computing codes and numerical tools. It has been practically designed for spatially organized data, *i.e.* fields, used as inputs and outputs by simulation tools. Practically, it is an XML file containing the description, for each grid supporting the fields, of its topology, its geometry, its dimensions, as well as the data arrays, types and dimensions of field defined on the grid. Rather than writing the heavy data describing gris and fields in to the XML file, the XDMF syntax allow to refer to arrays stored in HDF5 data files. In that case, and **in the case of the `SampleData` file pair, the XDMF file can be seen as an external metadata file allowing to interpret raw binary data stored in a HDF5 file as spatially organized data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important feature of thos HDF5/XDMF file pairs, is that they are a rather standard format. In particular, a reader for this format is implemented in the powerfull and popular 3D visualization software Paraview. **The `SampleData` class ensures that both HDF5 and XML are always synchronized together and with the content of the dataset.** This means that whenever users add spatially organized data into a `SampleData`  HDF5 dataset, they can simply visualize their dataset content by opening with Paraview the XMDF file."

    "* **Mesh Groups** are HDF5 groups designed to store data describing 2D or 3D meshes, *i.e.* grids described by node coordinates and elements connectivities, supporting scalar or tensorial fields. They can be used to store data coming from finite element simulations, CAD designs etc...They are actually 3 types of image groups:\n",
