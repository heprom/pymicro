    "The dataset has indeed been created with a content that conforms to the data model prescribed by the `minimal_data_model` method of the `Microstructure` class. Each of these items corresponds to data used systematically to study a polycrystalline material sample. In this context, the implementation of the data model serves the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it can be used as a standard data model for polycrystalline data sets, thus promoting data exchange and interoperability\n",
    "* it allows to implement a high level interface with reduced complexity to interact with these data items \n",

    "The interface is provided by the `Microstructure` class, that allows to perform data processings that are frequently used in material science on polycrystalline datasets. In addition, the pre-existing data model facilitates the implementation of new processing functionalities within the class. This is illustrated here by the `grains` class attribute, that has been associated to the `GrainDataTable` data item in the dataset, as shown by the printed information above. This attribute an accessible and explicit object to get information and apply processing on the data describing the grains of the microstructure represented by the dataset. "
